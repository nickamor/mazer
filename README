Build:
Run the following commands on a commandline;
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Run:
Run the executable produced by the build (./mazer/mazer) with the following
arguments:

--g seed width height   Generate a maze of size (width * height) from the given
                        seed
--ga seed width height  Generate using the Aldous-Broder algorithm (default)
--ge seed width height  Generate using the Eller algorithm
--pb                    Solve the current maze using Breadth-First Search
--pd                    Solve the current maze using Depth-First Search
--pm                    Solve the current maze using Dijkstra’s algorithm with 
                        manhattan distance heuristic
--pe                    Solve the current maze using Dijkstra’s algorithm with 
                        euclidean distance heuristic
--lb filename           Load the given filename as a binary maze file
--sb filename           Save the current maze to a binary maze file at filename
--sv filename           Save the current maze as an SVG document
