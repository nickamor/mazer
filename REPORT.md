- Does your final application resemble your original class diagram and why/why not? What changes did you end up making for your design that you did not foresee?
    Yes it does. The implementation changed a lot but the design itself proved resilient.

- Discuss the difference in performance of each generation/solving algorithm and potential reasons for these differences.
